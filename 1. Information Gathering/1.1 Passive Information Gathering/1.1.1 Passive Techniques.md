## Google Dorking
Use strings and operators to refine searches on Google. There are resources that can assist with this such as:
https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database

`site:megacorpone.com` - restricts results to only those from the target domain
`filetype:txt` - only returns results for .txt files
`ext:php` - quick check to see if the site is running on PHP. Can also do this for .aspx etc.
`-filetype:html` - excludes .html results
`intitle:"index of" "parent directory"` returns pages that contain "index of" in the title and "parent directory" on the page. Can return some very useful results
`intext:"words"` - returns results where the text contains specific words

We can use this to look for sensitive information or for employees etc.

## Info Gathering Sites
#### Netcraft

https://www.netcraft.com/tools/

ISP web portal that performs info gathering tasks. Considered passive as we never directly interact with our target.
- DNS search
- Site report
- Technologies used
- Subdomains
#### Shodan

https://www.shodan.io/

Very useful for finding internet connected devices.
- Open ports
- Certificates
#### Security Headers & TLS/SSL

https://securityheaders.com/
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

Checks for common issues on sites such as missing security headers, TLS / SSL misconfigurations, etc.

## Open-Source Code
Code stored online can provide insight into programming languages and frameworks used by an organisation. Sometimes, there may be sensitive information stored.

Github search is particularly flexible.

- `owner:megacorpone` - searches for content owned by that organisation or person
- `path:users` - searches for files with the word "users" in the filename

Manual searches for small repos. [Gitrob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob) and [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) for large ones.
