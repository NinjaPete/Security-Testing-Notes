DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses.
## DNS Record Types

| Record Type | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NS          | Name Server contains the authoritative servers hosting DNS records for a domain.                                             |
| A           | The Host record. Contains the IPv4 address of a hostname.                                                                    |
| AAAA        | Contains the IPv6 address of a hostname.                                                                                     |
| MX          | Mail Exchange. Contains the name of the server responsible for handling mail. There can be multiple MX records for a domain. |
| PTR         | Pointer Record. Used for reverse lookup (IP to hostname).                                                                    |
| CNAME       | Canonical Name. Aliases for other hosts.                                                                                     |
| TXT         | Text records can contain arbitrary data for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.                         |
###### Return IP
`host example.com` - returns the IP address
```
host example.com
example.com has address 93.184.215.14
example.com has IPv6 address 2606:2800:21f:cb07:6820:80da:af6b:8b2c
example.com mail is handled by 0 .
```
###### Return different record types
`host -t mx example.com` - returns the MX records
#### Identify subdomains
We can use DNS lookups to verify the existence of subdomains
`host notreal.example.com` -returns an error for not found
```
host notreal.example.com
Host notreal.example.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
```
`host real.example.com` - returns the IP address for the subdomain

###### Bruteforce Subdomain by Wordlist
We could brute force this with a list of subdomains with a for loop:
`for sub in $(cat subdomains.txt); do host $sub.example.com; done | grep -v "not found"`

###### Bruteforce Subdomain by IP
If we identify an IP for a subdomain, we might surmise that other subdomains are on the same range:
`for ip in $(seq 200 254); do host 12.34.56.$ip; done | grep -v "not found"`

This only works if the PTR records are set up.

## Tools
#### DNSRecon
###### Standard usage
`dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -t std`
`-d` specifies domain `-t` specifies the type of enumeration to perform
###### With a list
`dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -D ~/list.txt -t brt`
`-D` specifies a file list.
The enumeration type is set to bruteforce so this will bruteforce subdomains off of that list.
#### DNSEnum
`dnsenum example.com` - performs standard enumeration including reverse lookups, netranges, bruteforcing.
