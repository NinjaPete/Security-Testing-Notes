## Identifying XSS

#### Identify Parameters
Look for [[1.2.5 Web Application Enumeration#Parameter Fuzzing|parameters]] that can be manipulated by the user, particularly ones that either remain on the page (comments, file names), or are returned in the URL.
#### Fuzz Payloads
Using Burp's Intruder, fuzz with some common [[XSS Fuzzing Payloads]].
#### Filter Results
Look for a reflected response by comparing content length and check manually. Can also use Burp's `Grep - Match` and add:
```
alert(
<script>
<img src=
javascript:
onerror=
document.cookie
```
