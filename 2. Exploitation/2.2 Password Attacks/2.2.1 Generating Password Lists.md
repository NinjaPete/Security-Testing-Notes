## Identify Passwords
This can be existing passwords from a breach, or likely passwords for the users based on company name, location, or personal information.

## Creating the List

There are many tools to do this. Below example will be using Hashcat which describes how to create rules which can be applied to lists: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack
###### Create Rule
This can get very large very quickly so generally we want to try to make a list that conforms to a standard pattern. 
```
c      # Capitalize the first letter
$1     # Append '1' to the end
$!     # Append '!' to the end
c$1    # Capitalize the first letter and append '1'
c$!    # Capitalize the first letter and append '!'
$1$!   # Append '1' and '!'
c$1$!  # Capitalize the first letter, append '1' and '!'
```

Place this text into a `.rule` file
###### Mangle Password List
`hashcat -r mangle.rule pass.lst > newpass.lst`
**Note:** Consider trying these one at a time instead of all together as the list can grow very large, very quickly.
