## Identify Passwords
This can be existing passwords from a breach, or likely passwords for the users based on company name, location, or personal information.

## Creating the List

There are many tools to do this. Below example will be using Hashcat which describes how to create rules which can be applied to lists: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack
###### Create Rule
This can get very large very quickly so generally we want to try to make a list that conforms to a standard pattern. 
```
c
$1
$!
c$1
c$!
$1$!
c$1$!
```

Place this text into a `.rule` file
###### Mangle Password List
`hashcat -r mangle.rule pass.lst --stdout > newpass.lst`
**Note:** Consider trying these one at a time instead of all together as the list can grow very large, very quickly.
