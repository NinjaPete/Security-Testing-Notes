If you find git on a machine and have access, navigate to the repository.
###### Check status
`git status`
###### Check the log
`git log`
###### Check difference between commits
`git show <hash>`
**NOTE:** The hash is optional but if there are a lot of commits it'd be worthwhile
###### Revert to previous commit
`git checkout <hash>`
**Note:** This could break the application being tested. Use with caution.
